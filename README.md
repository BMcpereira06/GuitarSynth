# Configuration
config.h
```cpp
#define ANALOGUE_PORT        A0
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT0    22
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT1    24
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT2    26
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT3    28
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT4    30
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT5    32
#define THUMBWHEEL_INPUT6    3
```

Here you can configure which pins to be used by for the guitar input reading, and for the switch that selects the instrument.
